* Misc Info *
My second q3 model released. Ash is the main character from the Evil Dead movie trilogy. Darwin was even kind enough to make an Autolycus skin, who, if Im not mistaken, is a character Bruce Campbell reprised quite a few times on the "Hercules" and "Xena" syndicated shows. And just so you dont say to Darwin (skin artist) "What happened? The Default, CTF, Possessed, and Autolycus skins kick ass, but the m-ash2 and m-aod skins suck ass." Remember that I did them, and send those complaints to me. 
So to recap:
Default, Autolycus, Possessed, CTF (thats red and blue); beautifully crafted by Darwin Allen
m-ash2, m-aod; painful to look at thanks to MOOKY

Now the Paul Steed thing, the death and swim animations are from the visor bips that he released to the public.

*Construction*
Editors                 :3d Studio Max R2.5 (mesh), max plug-in Character Studio (animation), Q3data (generate md3s), Nphernos MD3 Compiler (finishing up md3s), Nphernos Skin Tool (skin mapping, Md2 version) and paint programs to do the m- skins (read misc info), which Im sure you dont want to imitate

Build Time              :Dont remember, worked on "Ash" and like 5 other models at the same time

* How to use this accessory *
throw all pk3s in your baseq3 directory

*small faq*
Q: The model isnt showing up in the model select screen?
A: First make sure you put the pk3s in your baseq3 directory (its 4 lines up, how'd you miss it), if that doesnt work try creating a folder named ash in your players directory (like this *baseq3/models/players/ash*)  and put these readmes in there (would be nice if you kept them, but your not even reading them)

Q: Wheres my baseq3 directory?
A: This ones really, really, really simple, close this text document, turn off your computer, and beat your self into a coma so your ignorance can no longer be witnessed by anyone.

Q: I still cant find my baseq3 directory.
A: Another easy one, you closed this text document as soon as I said to, didnt you.

Q: Where do I download your model?
A: Get the hell away from me!!! Your reading my models text document, if you have my text, then wouldnt common sense lead you to believe that you may actually already have the model in your possession.

*likes*
Long walks on the beach.
Candle light dinners.
Big ass watermelon hooters.
Pie.

*dislikes*
How pointless this is getting.
The skins that I did.


ENJOY! (what are you still doing here, go play some Quake3, enjoy the model, get a haircut, get a job or your out of this house!!!, hire me so I can have some money)
