PeonSDK - A lightweight game development sdk
=============================================

PeonSDK is meant to be a simple, fast, and nearly cross-platform and object oriented game development API. It provides
access to windowing, graphics and audio.

The current targeted platform is Win32, but the SDK is built upon cross-platform tooling making other platforms an option.

The SDK is striving towards creating an easy-to-pickup 2D game development platform which allows easy access to the
underlying components (such as OpenGL), but also creates a thin layer to help you stay productive.

It is written in C++.

Contribute
===========

The Peon-SDK is released as an open-source project, and could use a bit of help on making it better, focused
approach to developing 2D games.

Feel free to fork the project on github, maintain your own version and send me pull requests periodically for 
suggested merges of your work.


Support
=======

I am no longer actively supporting this project, nor intend to make any real architectural revamps to it. It 
was originally conceived and written circa 2002 for my book, "Game Programming in C++:Start to Finish" by
Charles River Media (now Cengage Learning). This codebase is posted for archival and learning purposes.
